The USDA Women’s Health Survey dataset (nutrient.txt) contains five types of women’s nutrient intakes which were measured from a random sample of 737 women aged 25-50 years in the United States.

Tasks

Analyze the dataset according to the following steps:

<ol>

 <li>Calculate sample mean and sample standard deviation of each variable.</li>

 <li>The recommended intake amount of each nutrient is given in the table below. For each nutrient, apply a univariate t-test to test if the population mean of that variable equals the recommended value. Set the significance level at (alpha = .05).</li>

 <li>Repeat step 2, now using the Bonferroni and Holm’s Methods to control the FWER for the five tests. How does this affect the results?</li>

 <li>Based on the results you obtained in steps 2 and 3, how would you interpret your test results? Do you think the US Women meet the recommended nutrient intake amount? If not, what would you suggest to the public?</li>

</ol>

<h2>Recommended Levels</h2>

<ul>

 <li>Calcium: 1000mg</li>

 <li>Iron: 15mg</li>

 <li>Protein: 60g</li>

 <li>Vitamin A: 800 (mu)g</li>

 <li>Vitamin C: 75mg</li>

</ul>

<h2>Remarks</h2>

Your R Markdown Notebook report should have a introduction, body, conclusion (and optional appendix). Importantly, your code should run!
